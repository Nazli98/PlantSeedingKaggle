# Plant Seedings Classification (from Kaggle)
The dataset comprises 12 species of a particular plant. The project aims to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. I used PyTorch to split data into train, test, and validation datasets, then load the data. 
I used Convolutional Neural Networks to classify this dataset and Relu as an activation function.
